# Boxie

Boxie is a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js) application for storing and indexing Vagrant base box images. It's designed to be a free and open source alternative to [VagrantCloud](https://vagrantcloud.com).

## Project Goals

At a minimum the project should match the basic functionality of Vagrant Cloud (adding images, searching images and showing an image description). More advanced functionality could include some sort of functionality that integrates with git and / or continuous integration to automatically add images. It would also be neat to have integration with cloud storage services.
